title Calculation of Potential Risk (P)

' Define the main Potential Risk (P) calculations
RECTANGLE "Potential Risk for Property (P)" {
  +P = q * g * i * e * v * z
}

RECTANGLE "Potential Risk for Occupants (P1)" {
  +P1 = q * i * e * v * z
}

RECTANGLE "Potential Risk for Activities (P2)" {
  +P2 = g * i * e * v * z
}

' Define the factors with descriptions
RECTANGLE "Fire Load Factor (q)" {
  +Description: Amount that can burn per area unit (mÂ²). Measure for fire duration.
}

RECTANGLE "Spread Factor (i)" {
  +Description: Ease of fire spread through a building.
  +Calculated from: average dimension of the content (m), flame propagation class (M), and destruction temperature (T).
}

RECTANGLE "Area Factor (g)" {
  +Description: Horizontal influence of the fire.
  +Linked to: size and shape of the fire compartment.
  +Calculated from: theoretical length (l) and equivalent width (b).
}

RECTANGLE "Level Factor (e)" {
  +Description: Vertical influence of the fire.
  +Based on: level number (E).
}

RECTANGLE "Venting Factor (v)" {
  +Description: Influence of smoke and heat inside the building.
  +Compares: venting capacity of the compartment with the sources of smoke.
  +Calculated from: smoke venting factor (k), ceiling height, and mobile fire load (Qm).
}

RECTANGLE "Access Factor (z)" {
  +Description: Difficulty for outside help to reach the fire area.
  +Calculated from: distance between access level and fire area level, number of access directions, and compartment size.
